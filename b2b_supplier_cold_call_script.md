# Cold Calling Script

## Web Developer → B2B Service Suppliers (Wholesale / Distribution)



**Target Niches**

**Primary Goal**
Book a short discovery call to explore redesigning their website into a **B2B ordering, quoting, and account management system**.

---

## 1. Connection Stage — Disarm & Get Permission

“Hey, is this **[First Name]**?
Yeah, this is **[Your Name]**.

Look, I know you weren’t expecting my call and you’re probably in the middle of something —
would it be okay if I quickly explain why I’m calling, and then you can tell me if it makes sense to keep chatting?”

*(Wait for permission)*

---

## 2. Reason for the Call — Context & Relevance

“Appreciate that.

So I’m reaching out to a few **local suppliers** this week — companies that sell to other businesses.
We’ve been noticing a lot of suppliers are either **outgrowing their websites** or still relying heavily on phone calls and emails for orders.

I was curious — **how are customers currently placing orders or requesting quotes from you?**”

---

## 3. Situation Questions — Understand Their Workflow

“Is that mostly handled by phone and email, or do you have anything online for that?”

“Do customers have accounts with pricing built in, or is everything manual?”

“How long has that process been in place?”

*(Use soft follow‑ups like: “Got it… tell me a bit more about that.”)*

---

## 4. Problem Awareness — Surface Friction

“Does that setup work as smoothly as you’d like?”

“Do you ever run into issues with:

- repetitive orders
- pricing mistakes
- back‑and‑forth on quotes or proofs
- customers asking for invoices or reorder history?”

“Why do you think that keeps happening?”

“Has that ever slowed things down or taken time away from higher‑value work?”

---

## 5. Solution Awareness — Paint the Ideal System

“Let me ask you this.

If customers could:

- log into an account
- see **their pricing**
- reorder in a few clicks
- submit custom quote requests
- approve proofs online
- and place recurring orders automatically

how do you think that would change your day‑to‑day operations?”

“What would that free you or your team up to focus on instead?”

---

## 6. Consequence Question — Gentle Urgency

“And if things stay the way they are — phone, email, spreadsheets —
do you feel like that could eventually limit how much you can scale or compete with suppliers who are more automated?”

---

## 7. Low‑Pressure Close — Discovery Call

“Honestly, I don’t know yet if what we build would even be a fit for you.

But it might be worth a **quick 10–15 minute call** just to look at your current setup and see if there’s anything that could be improved or streamlined.

Would it be a bad idea to look at **Thursday morning or Friday afternoon**?”

---

# Common Objections

## Objection: “Can you just send me some info?”

“Yeah, that’s no problem at all.

Just so I’m clear — what kind of info would you want to see?”

*(Pause — let them answer)*

“Got it. And what would you be hoping that info shows you to decide whether this is worth exploring further?”

*(Re‑centers on their pain points)*

“I’m happy to send something over, but honestly it might be easier if we just blocked off **10 minutes** so I can show you what would actually be relevant to *your* business.

Would that be a bad idea?”

---

## Objection: “We already have someone / a website.”

“Yeah, that makes total sense — a lot of suppliers I speak with already do.”

*(Neutral, calm tone)*

“Out of curiosity though —
is there anything you wish your current site did better?
Like ordering, quoting, or handling repeat customers?”

*(Let them speak)*

“If there were a way to reduce manual work or improve customer ordering without replacing everything —
would it be crazy to at least look at what that might look like?”

---

## Notes for You (Not Spoken)

- You are **not selling a website** — you are diagnosing operational friction
- Keep tone calm, curious, and consultative
- The goal is **discovery**, not pitching features
- Silence is your friend

---

**End Goal:**
A short call where you review their current workflow and explore whether a custom B2B web system could save time, reduce errors, and increase order volume.
